# Google ADK Projects 🚀

A curated collection of **hands-on projects, demos, and experiments** built with **Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)**.  
This repo is designed to help developers quickly learn, explore, and build with ADK — from simple standalone agents to advanced multi-agent workflows.

---

## 📚 What is ADK?

The **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** makes it easy to build intelligent, tool-using agents powered by Gemini models.  
With ADK you can:
- Create agents with clear roles and instructions
- Add built-in tools (Google Search, Code Execution, Vertex AI Search)
- Define custom function tools
- Orchestrate multi-agent workflows (sequential, parallel, loop)
